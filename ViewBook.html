            The unforgettable, heartbreaking story of the unlikely friendship between a wealthy boy 
            and the son of his father’s servant, The Kite Runner is a beautifully crafted novel set in 
            a country that is in the process of being destroyed. It is about the power of reading, 
            the price of betrayal, and the possibility of redemption; and an exploration of the power 
            of fathers over sons—their love, their sacrifices, their lies.
        </p>

            A sweeping story of family, love, and friendship told against 
            the devastating backdrop of the history of Afghanistan over 
            the last thirty years, The Kite Runner is an unusual and powerful 
            novel that has become a beloved, one-of-a-kind classic.

            Khalid Hosseini, Afghan-born American novelist who was known for his vivid description 
            of Afghanistan, most probably in The Kite Runner and Thousand Splendid Suns.

            An absolute must-read book.

            The Kite Runner is a coming-of-age story based in pre-war Afghanistan to the modern-day US. 
            The novel is rich in the Afghan perspective as well as universal themes we can all identify with 
            -- childhood friendship, regret and redemption, father and son love.

            The ways Khaled Hosseini describes each setting and character is near perfect. 
            There were times I couldn't put this book down. Pre and post-war Afghanistan is so perfectly 
            described that I felt as if I was there. There is a rollercoaster of emotions in this book as it 
            also deals with several dark themes such as betrayal, loss of innocence, and regret. 
            It can be distressing in many parts, but the story redeems itself ultimately in the end.

        This novel is very beautiful and poetic. I applaud Hosseini for 
        bringing in an Afghan perspective to the American mainstream. Each character 
        and conflict brought to life and is a new perspective that hasn't been seen before.
